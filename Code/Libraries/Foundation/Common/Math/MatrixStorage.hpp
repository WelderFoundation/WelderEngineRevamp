/// Used to set the way matrices are laid out. If 0, then the columns of an
/// orthogonal basis matrix represent the xyz-axes of the rotation. If 1, then
/// the rows of an orthogonal basis matrix represent the xyz-axes of the
/// rotation. This only changes how the memory is laid out for matrices, the
/// matrix interfaces do not change (and neither does the code that uses them).
/// The reason why this should be changed is for the memory layout with respect
/// to SIMD operations. Early versions of SSE (2 and 3) are more efficient with
/// column operations (so basis vectors in the rows, I know it's backwards but
/// go with it), and xmvector and SSE 4 are more efficient with row operations
/// (so basis vectors in the columns).
