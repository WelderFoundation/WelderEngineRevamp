// ==================================
// NetObject Uninitialization Phases:
// ==================================

// [#] = Phase occurs for all objects in the uninitialization group in order

// [:] (All net channel properties guaranteed uninitialized in all cases)
// [1] NetChannelPropertyUninitialized Event
// [2] NetObjectOffline Event
// [3] C++ OnDestroy / Script Destroyed

// ============================
// Attachments and Detachments:
// ============================

// Attachments, Detachments, and Reorders are IGNORED when serializing replicas
// in their original creation hierarchy structure. This is because we use Family
// Trees which represent the original net object archetype hierarchy order.
// Family Trees are carefully updated to mark destroyed or forgotten net objects
// as absent. Absent net objects are destroyed during their C++
// AllObjectsCreated phase. This means replication occurs indirectly, by
// replicating Family Trees according to which of their net objects are still
// present (not absent). Remotely, after deserializing replicas in their
// original creation hierarchy structure, Attachments, Detachments, and Reorders
// are then applied. Effectively, replication occurs indirectly by transmitting
// replicas as they were originally created and then updating them via their net
// properties immediately after the fact. Specifically, Attachments,
// Detachments, and Reorders occur when reading ReplicaData inside the C++
// AllObjectsCreated phase. Because the C++ AllObjectsCreated phase is already
// in a predetermined order, this hierarchy shifting will not break our
// deserialization order.

// "External" Attachments (attaching other objects not a part of an internal
// archetype hierarchy) are performed once both the Parent and Child exist.
// Normally this is not a problem, except in the case of clients receiving a
// network game. It's very possible that parents and children are replicated out
// of order. Because of our use of Family Trees, it's not possible to replicate
// external attachments in their new hierarchy order. These relations
// unfortunately can become cyclic between Family Trees. So, in the case of
// external attachments, it is undefined whether or not a parent or it's child
// will be replicated first. (Internal attachments are never a problem) If the
// Parent is replicated first: (Instant) When the Child is replicated, the Child
// will attach to the Parent inside the Child's "C++ AllObjectsCreated" phase,
// while the Child is reading it's ReplicaData. If the Child is replicated
// first: (Delayed) When the Parent is replicated, the Child will attach to the
// Parent inside the Parent's "C++ AllObjectsCreated" phase, *after* the Parent
// reads it's ReplicaData as a special case. Finally, it is guaranteed that all
// external attachments (Instant or Delayed) will be correctly applied prior to
// the NetLevelStarted and NetGameStarted Events.
