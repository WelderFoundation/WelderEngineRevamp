//                            Variant Configuration //

//
// These Variant configuration options allow us to easily decide what missing
// stored type functionality we consider acceptable. None of the following
// options alter Variant's actual behavior in any way, they only toggle asserts
// notifying the developer that potentially undesirable fallback behavior was
// performed during a Variant operation (because the requested stored type
// functionality was unavailable).
//

/// Error On Missing Default Constructor?
/// During variant default assignment, stored types without a default
/// constructor will be zero-initialized instead. Note: Zero-initialized is
/// likely not a valid state for complex types! Highly recommended to keep this
/// assert enabled. If enabled, variant will assert immediately before this
/// occurs. If disabled, variant will remain silent when this occurs.

/// Error On Missing Move Constructor?
/// During variant move assignment, stored types without a move constructor will
/// be copied instead. If enabled, variant will assert immediately before this
/// occurs. If disabled, variant will remain silent when this occurs.

/// Error On Missing ComparePolicy?
/// During variant equality comparison, stored types without a valid
/// ComparePolicy will return false instead. If enabled, variant will assert
/// immediately before this occurs. If disabled, variant will remain silent when
/// this occurs.

/// Error On Missing HashPolicy?
/// During variant hash operation, stored types without a valid HashPolicy will
/// return 0 instead. If enabled, variant will assert immediately before this
/// occurs. If disabled, variant will remain silent when this occurs.
#define VARIANT_ERROR_ON_MISSING_HASH_POLICY 1

/// Error On Missing ToString Function?
/// During variant value to string conversion, stored types without a global
/// ToString function will return String() instead. If enabled, variant will
/// assert immediately before this occurs. If disabled, variant will remain
/// silent when this occurs.

/// Error On Missing ToValue Function?
/// During variant string to value conversion, stored types without a global
/// ToValue function will assign a default constructed value instead. If
/// enabled, variant will assert immediately before this occurs. If disabled,
